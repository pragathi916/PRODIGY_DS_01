The provided R script is designed to analyze and visualize demographic data stored in a CSV file. It first reads the data, ensuring consistency in the 'Gender' column by converting values to lowercase and removing leading and trailing whitespaces. The script then generates a bar chart depicting the distribution of genders in the population, using pink and blue colors for visual distinction. Additionally, it creates a histogram to illustrate the age distribution, with green bars and a specified age range. Users can customize the file path and further adapt the code for their specific dataset. This script serves as a valuable tool for quick insights into gender and age demographics, making it suitable for introductory data exploration tasks.
